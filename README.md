Generate frequency response function (FRF) data of a specified water pipeline system for TFR-FLDenseNet.

## How to generate data
* Run the script "LeakScale.m" to generate data with different leak scale
* Run the script "SpeedAndFric.m" to generate data with different friction factor and wave speed uncertainties
* There are some configurations in each script that you can change
* The data are stored in .mat files in corresponding folder after a successfully run

## Write the data into txt files
